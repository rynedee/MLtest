Project

11.4.19 -- This is a two-part project to show a basic understanding of HTML and Python while familarizing myself with the use of essential collaborative tools such as repl.it and GitHub.

HTML

The HTML portion will consist of a webpage that shares visual simularities with a newspaper. It will contain some personal information and feature up-to-date headlines from a variety of sources. 

<i>Current Status: I've tapped into the BBC's US/Canada feed to populate the headlines and am exploring other news sources for a variety of topics of interest that will rotate along the bottom of the page. Another need is to figure out how to import the results from Python scripts to populte my webpage. I can use Python to grab specific datapoints from an rss feed, how I then inject those datapoints into HTML so they can be viewed on a webpage is beyond me at this point.</i>

In keeping with the theme of a newspaper there will also be an implementation of the classic game Hangman that was written in Python. This Hangman game is from the MIT OpenCourseWare course Intro into Computer Science and Programming in Python 6.0001. Part of the code was provided by MIT (a word list (words.txt), the loading of that list, and the choosing of a random word from said list) along with some guidance on structure and purpose.

<i>Current Status: The game works. I have some formatting to do to make it look nice in it's much narrower new home. Just need to play through all the different combinations. Do need to check out the options for the embed box so that the source code is hidden from the jump and a note to click the play button to load a game.</i>
